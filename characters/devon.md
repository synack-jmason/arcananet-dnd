# 🌩️ Devon “Ping” Ramos – Level 10 Druid (Circle of the Moon)

Devon was a NOC operator long before the Arcana dropped, known for reading netflow logs like omens. They spoke to packet streams and load balancers as if they had souls—and maybe they did. When magic came, Devon already had the instincts. All that changed was the language.

Now a **Circle of the Moon Druid**, Devon shifts into spectral beasts to defend teammates, sniffs out threats through arcane senses, and speaks the language of both nature and networks. They are presence and perimeter, shape and signal.

## Race:

**Firbolg**

**Physical Description:** Tall, quiet, and serene, Devon wears a long fiber-cloak woven from naturally fireproof vines. Their ArcanaNet badge hangs from a vine-wrapped carabiner, pulsing softly. Moss grows between their fingers, and they smell like ozone and cedar.

### Racial Traits:

* **Firbolg Magic** – Cast *Detect Magic* and *Disguise Self* once per short rest
* **Hidden Step** – Turn invisible as a Bonus Action until your next turn (1x/short rest)
* **Powerful Build** – Count as one size larger for carrying, lifting, and pushing
* **Speech of Beast and Leaf** – Can communicate with animals and plants
