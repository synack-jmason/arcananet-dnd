# 🎭 Riley Drake – Level 10 Sorcerer (Wild Magic)

Riley majored in theatre and minored in mayhem. Their stage presence translated seamlessly to social engineering, where charm and chaos were job requirements. They could talk their way past firewalls and through locked doors with the same confidence they used to command a spotlight.

When the **Arcana dropped**, Riley didn’t gain control—they gained possibilities. Their magic is unpredictable, vibrant, and barely contained. They’re a **Wild Magic Sorcerer**—every spell is a gamble, every moment an improv set.

## Race:
**Half-Elf**

**Physical Description:**
Riley wears a mismatched cloak made of theater curtains, carries a wand disguised as a mic, and has glitter embedded permanently in their hair. Their ArcanaNet badge doubles as a stage pass. One of their eyes sparkles a bit too literally.

### Racial Traits:
* **Darkvision** – See in darkness up to 60 feet
* **Fey Ancestry** – Advantage on saves vs being charmed, immune to magical sleep
* **Skill Versatility** – Proficient in Deception and Performance
