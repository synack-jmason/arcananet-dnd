# ⚔️ Jordan Kim – Level 10 Barbarian (Ancestral Guardian)

Once a Marine, always a protector. Jordan Kim didn’t just serve—they stood between their squad and danger, every time. When they transitioned to cybersecurity, they brought that same ethos into blue teaming and threat hunting, shielding orgs from harm with diligence and grit.

When the **Arcana dropped**, Jordan's protective instincts surged. Spirits of digital ancestors whispered strategies in their ear, fortifying them with purpose. As an **Ancestral Guardian Barbarian**, Jordan soaks damage, draws enemy focus, and uses spectral allies to shield their team.

## Race:

**Goliath**

**Physical Description:** Towering and broad, Jordan has arms like bridge pylons and tribal tattoos that shimmer when they rage. Their ArcanaNet badge is embedded in a dog tag. Always in cargo pants and combat boots, their massive frame radiates calm readiness—until provoked.

### Racial Traits:

* **Powerful Build** – Count as one size larger for carrying, lifting, and pushing
* **Stone's Endurance** – Reduce damage by **1d12 + CON mod** once per short rest (Reaction)
* **Mountain Born** – Resistance to cold damage, acclimated to high altitudes
