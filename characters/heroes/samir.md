**🌐 Samir Patel – Level 10 Monk (Way of the Open Hand)**

Once a platform engineer managing DevSecOps pipelines, Samir lived in a terminal window. Fluent in YAML, regex, and coffee, he automated entire security deployments with scripts that read like poetry. In chaos, he found clarity. When the **Arcana dropped**, his discipline became literal force.

As a **Monk of the Open Hand**, Samir blends speed, focus, and pressure-point mastery. He disables foes without breaking stride and channels ki like a perfectly timed CI/CD pipeline.
