# 🛠️ Tyrone “Stack” Jackson – Level 10 Fighter (Battle Master)

 Tyrone used to man the grill at Burger Barge, flipping patties and dodging grease fires like a champ. Then one day, the register crashed and he rewrote the point-of-sale system with a fork and his phone.

 That same week, he enrolled in a cybersecurity bootcamp. Fast forward a few years and he’s the guy building detection rules at scale, hunting threats with a packet sniffer in one hand and a cold brew in the other. He’s been hands-on since Day One, and he still doesn’t trust anything he can’t test himself.

 When the **Arcana dropped**, Tyrone’s instincts didn’t change. His tools just got sharper. He became a **Fighter (Battle Master)**—disciplined, tactical, and always one step ahead.

#Race:
**Half-Orc**
## Physical Description:
 Broad-shouldered and easy-going, Tyrone wears a hoodie over tactical gear, headphones always around his neck, and a grin like he knows what’s in your logs. His ArcanaNet badge is clipped to a carabiner with his USB tools.

**Racial Traits:**

* **Darkvision** – See in darkness up to 60 feet
* **Relentless Endurance** – When reduced to 0 HP, you can drop to 1 HP instead (1×/long rest)
* **Savage Attacks** – When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon, roll one extra weapon die for damage

## 🎯 What You’re Good At

You’re the **tactician and frontliner**. You use brute force, precision, and clever combat tricks to control the flow of battle. You know when to strike, when to fake out your opponent, and when to draw the fire yourself.

## 🪄 Legendary Item

**Stormcaller Gauntlets** – Legendary Wondrous Item
Tyrone pulled these out of a fried industrial firewall during a red team gig in Atlanta. No one could explain how they were inside the chassis—or why they hummed when it rained.

* Once per turn, after hitting with a melee attack, deal an extra **1d6 lightning damage**
* You can cast **Lightning Bolt** (DC 16, 8d6 damage, 100-ft line) once per long rest
* Lightning dances around your fists and blade when you're angry or wet

# Combat

## Combat Resources

* **Second Wind** – \[ ] 1×/short rest – Bonus Action to regain 1d10 + 10 HP
* **Action Surge** – \[ ] 1×/short rest – Take an extra action on your turn
* **Superiority Dice** – \[ ] \[ ] \[ ] \[ ] \[ ] 5×/short rest – 1d10s used for special combat maneuvers

**Armor Class (AC): 18** – Chain Mail (base 16) + Battle Master reflexes

## 🧐 How Your Turn Works

⚠️ **You can only concentrate on one spell at a time.** Starting a new concentration spell ends the previous one.

Each round, you can:

* Take **1 Action** (attack, use a maneuver, drink a potion, dash, help, etc.)
* Take **1 Bonus Action** 
* Use **1 Reaction** 
* Move up to 30 feet

**Your Bonus Actions:**

* **Second Wind** – Regain 1d10 + 10 HP – Bonus Action, once per short rest

**Your Reaction:**

* **Riposte** – If an enemy within 5 ft misses you with a melee attack, you can make a melee attack back. Roll **1d20 +9** to hit. On hit: **2d6 + 4** slashing damage + **1d6 lightning** = **total: 3d6 + 4**

---

## ⚔️ Attacks

### 🪓 Greatsword (Heavy Melee)

* Roll **1d20 +9** to hit
* On hit: **2d6 + 4** slashing + **1d6 lightning** = **total: 3d6 + 4**

### 🗡️ Javelin (Thrown)

* Roll **1d20 +7** to hit
* On hit: **1d6 + 4** piercing damage = **total: 1d6 + 4**

* You have 3 total. You can throw up to that many before needing to recover them after battle.

## ✨ Combat Maneuvers (Battle Master)

Use a **Superiority Die (1d10)** to boost your attacks with powerful effects. These fall into two categories:

**Add to Attack Roll (before damage):**

* **Precision Attack** – Add 1d10 to your attack roll after seeing the result

**Add to Damage + Apply an Effect (after hit):**

* **Disarming Attack** – Add 1d10 to damage. Target makes a STR save (DC 16) or drops what they're holding
* **Trip Attack** – Add 1d10 to damage. Target makes a STR save (DC 16) or is knocked prone
* **Goading Attack** – Add 1d10 to damage. Target makes a WIS save (DC 16) or has disadvantage on attacks against anyone other than you until the end of their next turn – 1d10 + 3d6 + 4
