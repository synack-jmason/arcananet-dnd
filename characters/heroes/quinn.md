# 💼 Quinn Vargas – Level 10 Cleric (Forge Domain)

Quinn's life has always been about structure—policies, frameworks, spreadsheets, and the occasional audit panic. She started out in GRC, wrangling risk registers and ISO mappings until she could map them in her sleep. But compliance wasn't just a job for Quinn; it was a sacred duty.

When the **Arcana dropped**, her spreadsheets started glowing. Her risk heatmaps became literal fire. She embraced the divine spark of the Forge Domain and now crafts armor, shields, and divine arguments with equal fervor.
