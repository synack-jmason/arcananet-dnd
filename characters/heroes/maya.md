# 🥷 Maya “Ghostpatch” Lin – Level 10 Rogue (Arcane Trickster)

Once a top red teamer for a Fortune 100, Maya was known for slipping through the cracks—quiet, efficient, and devastating. She didn’t just find the backdoor—she left it cleaner than she found it. When a major breach put her on the other side, Maya pivoted. She now leads incident response for high-profile clients, patching gaps with equal parts code and cunning.

When the **Arcana dropped**, Maya felt right at home. Misdirection, infiltration, subtle magic? It was just another playbook.

As an Arcane Trickster, Maya blends rogue precision with illusion and enchantment magic. She's stealthy, clever, and surgically deadly with a blade or a spell.

## Race:
**Elf (High Elf)**

**Physical Description:** Maya moves like static in the air—here, then gone. Her dark hair is tied back in a functional braid, and her ArcanaNet badge is clipped inside her jacket lining. She wears a scarf woven with shimmering runes, and her eyes flicker with magical awareness.

### Racial Traits:

* **Darkvision** – See in darkness up to 60 feet
* **Fey Ancestry** – Advantage on saving throws vs being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep
* **Trance** – Meditate for 4 hours instead of sleeping
* **Cantrip** – You know one wizard cantrip: *Mage Hand*
