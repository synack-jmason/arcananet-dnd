# 🧬 Anya Malik – Level 10 Sorcerer (Clockwork Soul)

Anya was once a **risk analyst** in a tightly regulated sector, known for her order-of-operations wizardry and flowcharts that left no ambiguity. She read frameworks like prophecy and filed reports with metaphysical precision. When the **Arcana dropped**, her sense of balance became literal force. Magic didn’t disrupt her—it fell into formation.

Now a **Clockwork Soul Sorcerer**, Anya balances chaos with calm, reshaping probability and smoothing the sharp edges of the world around her. She makes reality behave, one spell at a time.
