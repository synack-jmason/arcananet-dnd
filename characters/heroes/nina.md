# 🕵️ Nina Blake – Level 10 Ranger (Gloom Stalker)

Nina worked the dark corners of the internet—deanonymizing threat actors, chasing child predators across continents, and pulling secrets from digital shadows. She was a dark web investigator for hire, with a track record and a conscience. When the **Arcana dropped**, Nina didn’t flinch. The shadows just got deeper.

Now a **Gloom Stalker Ranger**, Nina operates unseen and strikes first. She’s the hunter who sees what others miss, whose presence is only known when it’s already too late.
