# 🎤 Zoe Finch – Level 10 Bard (College of Eloquence)

Zoe started her career in network sales—racking up cold calls, charm damage, and impossible KPIs. But what made her dangerous wasn’t the tech. It was that she **listened**, **read the room**, and always knew the play two moves ahead.

When the **Arcana dropped**, Zoe barely blinked. She'd been building trust, persuading strangers, and turning chaos into opportunity her whole career. Now? She weaves magic like she used to handle meetings—**deftly, charmingly, and with just a hint of danger**.

In arcane form, Zoe is a **Bard (College of Eloquence)**—a persuasive speaker and agile caster who can bend minds, bolster allies, and humiliate enemies without raising her voice.

## Race: 
**Tiefling**

**Physical Description:** Zoe has short-cropped hair, a sly grin, and eyes that stay locked on yours just a little too long. She dresses for the job *and* the afterparty—typically in a blazer over tactical layers, her ArcanaNet badge clipped to a lapel like it's a fashion accessory.

### Racial Traits:

* **Darkvision** – See in darkness up to 60 feet
* **Hellish Resistance** – Resistance to fire damage
* **Infernal Legacy** – You know the *Thaumaturgy* cantrip. At higher levels, you can cast *Hellish Rebuke* and *Darkness* once per long rest using CHA

**Your Reaction:**

## ⚔️ Attacks

### 🎯 Rapier (Finesse Melee)

* Roll **1d20 +7** to hit
* On hit: **1d8 + 2** piercing damage (avg 6.5)

### 🎤 Vicious Mockery – Cantrip

* One creature you can see makes a WIS saving throw (DC 16)
* On fail: Takes **2d4 psychic damage** (avg 5) and has **disadvantage** on next attack
