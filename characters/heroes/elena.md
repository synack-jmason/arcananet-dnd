# 🧵 Elena Torres – Level 10 Artificer (Battle Smith)

Once a prodigy in hardware reverse engineering, Elena cracked bootloaders before she finished high school. She made a name salvaging electronics from e-waste dumps, building custom implants, and defeating chip-level DRM protections. When the **Arcana dropped**, Elena didn’t panic—she recompiled.

Now a **Battle Smith Artificer**, Elena commands a weaponized support drone, turns scraps into solutions, and brings both firepower and healing to the field. She’s the hacker who carries a soldering iron and a crossbow.

## Race:

**Gnome (Rock)**

**Physical Description:** Elena is barely over 3 feet tall with wild black curls, a tool harness across her chest, and goggles permanently smeared with flux residue. Her ArcanaNet badge is bolted to her mech-satchel, which doubles as a Wi-Fi jammer. Her companion construct, “Bugfix,” walks beside her like a loyal, slightly glitchy mechanical dog.

### Racial Traits:

* **Darkvision** – See in darkness up to 60 ft
* **Gnome Cunning** – Advantage on INT, WIS, and CHA saves against magic
* **Artificer’s Lore** – Add twice proficiency bonus to History checks about magic items, alchemy, or tech
* **Small Size** – You can move through the space of larger creatures
