# 🔍 Avery “ZeroDay” Jones – Level 10 Warlock (The Great Old One)

Once a black-hat hacker deep in the shadowy corners of the dark web, Avery spent years breaching systems for coin, curiosity, and clout. But redemption called. After a federal bust led to an unlikely plea deal, Avery reemerged as a threat intel consultant, teaching others how to stop the kinds of attacks they used to launch.

When the **Arcana dropped**, the eldritch voices that haunted Avery's dreams became real. They didn't resist—they made a pact. Now a **Warlock of the Great Old One**, Avery channels forbidden code, forgotten protocols, and mind-bending exploits.
