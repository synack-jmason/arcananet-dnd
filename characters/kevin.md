# 🧙‍♂️ Kevin “The Hermit” Cho – Level 10 Wizard (School of Divination)

Kevin was a recluse long before the Arcana dropped. He reverse-engineered malware from a solar-powered cabin in the Rockies, tracing nation-state backdoors with a paper notebook and an EMP wand he built himself. His predictions about zero-days were so accurate they seemed prophetic.

When magic emerged, Kevin didn’t panic. He meditated. And when he opened his eyes, he could see the threads of probability. He became a **Divination Wizard**, manipulating chance and rewriting reality with cold, analytical focus.
