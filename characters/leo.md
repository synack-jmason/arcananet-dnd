# 🌟 Leo Tran – Level 10 Bard (College of Swords)

Once a competitive eSports hacker known for flashy exploits and post-match rap battles, Leo shifted from fame to firewalls. As a red teamer turned purple team showman, his pen tests were half circus act, half security review. He believes flair is function.

When the **Arcana dropped**, Leo's blades sang with the same swagger he brought to conference CTFs. Now a **College of Swords Bard**, Leo blends precise martial strikes with arcane flourishes, dazzling and dismantling in equal measure.

## Race:

**Half-Elf**

**Physical Description:** Leo's hair is dyed in streaks of neon, his eyeliner immaculate. His coat sparkles with magical thread that shifts color with his movement. The ArcanaNet badge is pinned over his heart like a medal. Two rapiers hang at his hips, one humming with static.

### Racial Traits:

* **Darkvision (60 ft)**
* **Fey Ancestry** – Advantage on saves vs being charmed, immune to magical sleep
* **Skill Versatility** – Proficient in Acrobatics and Performance
