# 🛡️ Marcus “Ironclad” Reyes – Level 10 Paladin (Oath of the Shieldwall)


Marcus is a former **Army sergeant**, hardened in the digital trenches of the **3rd Cyber battalion**. These days, he leads a **Security Operations Center** at Boogle, protecting both his customers and his team like family. He’s the kind of guy who brings people to cons, checks the badge queue for fun, and dreams of giving a talk on-stage one day.

 When the **Arcana dropped**, he felt it like a pulse of gravity—an anchor, not a burden. His **Oath of the Shieldwall** wasn’t just a title—it was a truth he already lived.

 *“I protect this house, and everyone in it.”*

 His arcane form is a **Paladin**—a knight in **heavy armor**, wielding a **battleaxe and shield**, **handaxes** for backup throws, and **magic fueled by duty**. He can **heal teammates**, create protective **auras**, or **smite enemies** with bursts of **holy energy**. He leads from the front. He holds the line.


## Race:
**Mountain Dwarf**

**Physical Description:** Broad-shouldered and sturdy, Marcus has a tightly trimmed beard, calloused hands, and sharp eyes that miss nothing. His plate armor carries the faint glow of his oath magic, and his ArcanaNet badge is clipped beside an old-school metal security token.

### Racial Traits:

* **Darkvision** – See in darkness up to 60 feet
* **Dwarven Resilience** – Advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage
* **Dwarven Combat Training** – Proficient with battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, and warhammer
* **Tool Proficiency** – Proficient with smith’s tools
* **Stonecunning** – Double proficiency bonus on History checks related to stonework
